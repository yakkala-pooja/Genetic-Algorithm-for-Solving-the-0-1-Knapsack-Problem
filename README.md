# Genetic-Algorithm-for-Solving-the-0-1-Knapsack-Problem
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, optimizing the selection of items to maximize total value without exceeding weight capacity. It demonstrates the power of evolutionary algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems, offering a practical approach for solving real-world logistics challenges.
